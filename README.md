# üèùÔ∏è Atoll Segmentation Web App Demo ‚öôÔ∏è 

Climate change poses significanrt threats to the stability and sustainability of atoll ecosystems worldwide. To effectively monitor and quantify the impacts of climate change on atoll morphometrics, this study employs an unique approach using semantic segmentation, a deep learning based image analysis technique. High-resolution satellite imagery is processed and classified into distinct features of reef, island, and ocean components.

This is a web application that allows for easy segmentation of Atoll Morphometrics. The backend supports four models, each of a different image type that was all trained from scratch. The four image types are: RGB, NIR, SpecInd, and SSR.  

## üåü Project Overview : 
* Dataset: 288 distnct Atoll Images provided by Dr. Alejandra Geiger-Ortiz
* Model Training: Tensorflow and [Segmentation Gym](https://github.com/Doodleverse/segmentation_gym)
* Web App: HTML/CSS, Javascript, Flask
